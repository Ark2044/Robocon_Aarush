- Arduino Uno (or compatible)
- Cytron MDD10A
- IR Sensors
- Servo Motors
- DC Motors
- MCP 2515 (CAN Module)
- ESP 32
- Raspberrpi

## Software Dependencies

- Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

## Installation and Setup

1. **Arduino IDE Installation**: If you haven't already, download and install the Arduino IDE from the [official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

2. **Clone Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/team-robocon-crce-2022-23.git
